# ADSR
A Looping Version of the YuSynth ADSR

I decided to build a new envelope generator back in December 2022 to supplement / replace my old AR generators made from [MFOS](http://musicfromouterspace.com/) designs and my 
own ["ADSRduino"](https://github.com/m0xpd/ADSRduino).

I already knew Yves Usson's excellent [YuSynth site](https://yusynth.net/Modular/index_en.html) (having published a Eurorack version of the ['Simple VCA'](https://github.com/m0xpd/YuSynth-VCA-for-Eurorack)), and was interested by a comment on 
[Eddy Bergman's website](https://www.eddybergman.com/2020/03/synthesizer-build-part-24-adsr-with.html) about the YuSynth ADSR.

Eddy said:

"I can say without any doubt that this design is perfect if you want a good and reliable ADSR to pair with your VCA or to drive a filter. " 

That decided it - I would make a Eurorack version of Yves' 7555-based design. 

However, having added looping to my ADSRduino, I decided that I would also like to include the same looping functionality on the new envelope generator. 

So - here it is. A version of the YuSynth 7555 ADSR in 8HP with looping...
