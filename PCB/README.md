This folder contains design files for the m0xpd Looping ADSR.

There is a schematic file and a board file, developed in the EAGLE editor.

There is also a [BoM](https://github.com/m0xpd/ADSR/blob/main/PCB/m0xpd%20Looping%20ADSR%20v2.0%20Bill%20of%20Materials.txt), in the EAGLE's rather clumsy format.
